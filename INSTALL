GENERAL INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
---------------------------------
Installation is fairly simple. This software can also be run without any
Field System software.

1.) Install the Client first '/usr2/metclient'

2.) Make sure all requirements listed above are met.

    metclient
     |-- Makefile    - The make file for compiling Client.
     |-- INSTALL     - Installation instructions for client(s).
     |-- README              - Information.
     |-- metclient.sh        - bootup script for init.d
     |-- metclient_systemd.sh  bootup script for systemd
     |-- metclient           - executable.
     |-- lib                 - Source directory empty left for future use?.
     |-- metlog.ctl          - file logging and station information.
     `-- src                 - Source directory for Client and Server.
         |-- Makefile        - The make file for compiling client.
         |-- err_report.c    - Error handler.
         |-- logwx.c         - Format and send information to logging file.
         `-- metclient.c     - Client source for logging weather information.


3.) If you would like to startup a client for logging data.
    NOTE: The client is only needed if you would like to create a log file
          with only weather data. The Field System (FS) does not need this
          client to log data in your station observing file. The FS has it's
          own client that works with your existing 'wx' SNAP command.

    prompt> log in as root
    prompt> cd /usr2
    prompt> git clone https://github.com/nvi-inc/metclient
    prompt> chown -R prog.rtx metclient
    prompt> log in as prog
    prompt> cd /usr2/metclient
    prompt> make

4.) If you are going to run a client to create a weather data log.
    Using your favorite editor create a control file for the client.
    For completeness sake you should call it metlog.ctl and put it in
    /usr2/control directory. Remember that this is an example and
    you must create the file to match your enviroment.

    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    If you name the control file by any other name, other then 'metlog.ctl'
    and/or you don't put it the '/usr2/control' directory you MUST
    change the metclient.sh script mentioned at Item 2.) in STARTING CLIENT.
    change the metclient_systemd.sh script mentioned at Item 3.) in
    STARTING CLIENT.

    An example exists in your metclient directory

    example metlog.ctl file:
	*=COMMENT.
	*metget.ctl
	gg            station two-letter code
	0             place holder for sampling period for wind data (not used)
	60            logging period for all data (seconds)
	/usr2/log/wx  directory for logging data, must be < 27 characters
	GGAO7108      Station Name
	76.8265       Longitude
	39.0219       Latitude
	14.99         Station Elevation
	*

    The directory listed must exist. On a FS computer, we recommend you
    create it logged in as "root" with these commands:

       cd /usr2/log
       mkdir wx
       chmod a+rx wx
       chown -R oper.rtx wx

STARTING CLIENT:
----------------

1.) Running the metclient. Please run metclient from root.

    NOTE: The first parameter is the control file that was created by you
            in the /usr2/control directory.
          The second parameter is the network port of the server, if
            you are not using the default, you must specify
            it after the first parameter, 50001 is the default.
          The third parameter is the host for the server, if you are not
            using the default you must specify it after the second
            parameter. Default value is the alias 'met_server', which is the
            recommended value. This alias should also be used by the met. data
            server, gromet or metserver (if it running on this machine), and
            all clients. If the server is running on this machine, the alias
            should be put on the internal interface (localhost) line in
            /etc/hosts if data is only be served to the localhost. It should be
            put on the external interface line (with the machine's IP address)
            if it is also being served to other hosts. This makes it easy to
            switch interfaces, just change the line used and restart the server
            and all its clients. If the server is running on different machine,
            put 'met_server' on the line in /etc/hosts for that machine.

   prompt> log in as root.
   prompt> /usr2/metclient/metclient /usr2/control/metlog.ctl 50001 met_server &

2.) If you would like metclient to startup at boot time and your system uses
    init.d, which is deprecated. See #3 below for systemd, which is preferred,
    instructions.

    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    If you name the control file by any other name, other then 'metlog.ctl'
    and/or you don't put it the '/usr2/control' directory you MUST
    MUST change the metclient.sh script in /etc/init.d.

    Likewise if you aren't using the default network port you must specify
    it in the metclient.sh script in /etc/init.d.
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    prompt> log in as root
    prompt> cd /etc/init.d
    prompt> cp /usr2/metclient/metclient.sh .
    prompt> update-rc.d metclient.sh defaults

    Everytime you reboot your system, the metclient will start logging
    automatically.

    a.) If you wish to stop the metclient for some reason.
	as root:
	/etc/init.d/metclient.sh stop  (will stop the metclient)
	/etc/init.d/metclient.sh start (will start it up again)
	/etc/init.d/metclient.sh restart (will stop then start)

    b.) If you no longer want the client to startup at boot time you have
        two options. You can either remove the service or disable it.

        Removing:
        prompt> log in as root
        prompt> cd /etc/init.d
        prompt> rm metclient.sh
        prompt> update-rc.d -f metclient.sh remove

        Disabling:
        There is no option to use when calling update-rc.d that will
        disable the script (yet). This can be achieved manually by
        renaming the script in /etc/init.d, for example:
        prompt> cd /etc/init.d
        prompt> mv metclient.sh metclient.sh.disabled

        NOTE: When invoking update-rc.d with the remove option the script
              should have been deleted already. Flag '-f' will force removal
              of symlinks even if /etc/init.d/metclient.sh still exists

3.) If you would like metclient to startup at boot time and your system uses
    systemd, which is preferred. See #2 above for init.d, which is deprecated,
    instructions.

        disable it.

        systemctl disable metclient

4.) ===== Read the README file for logfile names and log file information. =====

You're done!

NOTES:
------

1. If the metclient saved a string without met data in the log file we might
   be able to tell from the string what happened.
   There are two possible "error" strings that give us information:

   a) A string with only date, time and 'wx' tell us that the metclient
      did not retrieve any data at all from the metserver.
      Example: 2013.119.14:07:00/wx/
      This will happen if the metserver is no longer running.

   b) A string with date, time, 'wx' and five commas tell us that the
      metclient did retrieve data from the metserver, but the data was
      badly formatted or missing.
      Example: 2013.119.14:07:00/wx/,,,,,
